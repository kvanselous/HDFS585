        <p>Drake, Aos, & Miller (2009) complied these results into five categories, separating the results by adult programs, juvenile programs, prevention programs, adult programs requiring additional research, and juvenile programs requiring additional research.  Largely, all the programs included for prevention of crime reduction showed a significant decrease in crime and positive economic impact.  These programs included pre-k education for low-income 3–4-year-old children and nurse family partnerships for mothers and children. Programs for adults that decreased crime and had a positive economic impact included vocational and general education programs in prison, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy programs in prisons and communities, drug treatment in prison such as therapeutic communities and outpatient services, drug treatment in community settings, and adult drug courts.  Programs for juveniles that decreased crime and had a positive economic impact included programs with Functional Family Therapy, teen courts, restorative justice programs for low-risk offenders, and family integrated transition programs.  Programs that did not show a decrease in crime and had a negative economic impact included intensive supervision programs for adults and juveniles.  One program for youth that increased crime, increased costs to victims, and increased cost to taxpayers included the <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2016/jun/3/scared-straight-programs-are-counterproductive/" target="_blank">Scared Straight </a> program. </p>          
        <p>To view the full list of findings and results, please click <a href="https://kvanselous.github.io/HDFS585/Report/" target="_blank">here</a> and navigate to page 184 to view the results in table Table 1.  Keep in mind, the results for each category are based on the average of all the programs evaluated within that category, as well as the assumption that the programs perform averagely (Drake, Aos, & Miller, 2009).  Additionally, the program’s impact on crime is used to estimate the cost benefit of having reduced crime victims per adult or youth, the cost benefit of reduced crime on taxpayers per adult or youth, a comparison of the program cost with alternative options per person, and the difference between the total cost vs the total benefits of the program per adult or youth participant.

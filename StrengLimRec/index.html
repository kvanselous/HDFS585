        <h2>Strengths, Limitations, and Recommendations </h2>
        <p>Overall, this study's strengths included its ability to assess a large array of statewide programing to inform future legislation efforts. The study's results not only informed the Washington State legislator, but also resulted in a shift of $48 million to the biennial budget to enhance delivery and development of evidenced-based programs across the state <b> AND </b> decreased the state’s future prison projections (Drake, Aos, & Miller, 2009).  Additional strengths of this study included its sample size of 545 studies included for metanalysis and its clear guidelines for selection criteria, which targeted outcome-based program evaluations that utilized comparison-group research designs.  This selection strategy allowed the study to capitalize on program evaluations that included a research design that allowed the evaluators to attribute change in outcomes to the specific program and not confounding variables (Center for Disease Control, 2011). This study also weighted its effect size to account for potential decreases in program effectiveness over time and utilized a 5-point Likert scale to capture the quality of each of the program evaluations.  This resulted in program evaluations that did not use comparison groups or used comparison groups but lacked control measures as being excluded from the study.  This scale also helped to emphasize studies that utilized experimental designs with randomized control groups.  Overall, these strategies are a strength for the study, as they reflect the evaluators attempt to account for differences in design and real-world issues that may impact the program.   Another strength of this study was its ability, to clearly outline many of its coding decisions, strategies for analysis, and results. </p>   
        <p>Although, the study capitalized on rigorous coding and selection strategies to include only high value program evaluations, this study also included several barriers.  Barriers of this study included its decisions to only focus on program evaluations that evaluated participants that fully completed the program. By only focusing on program completion, the evaluators missed an opportunity to assess if certain programs work for certain populations.  For example, one type of program may work for men better than women, work better in high-income areas than low-income areas, or work differently based on the participant or program providers ability to access resources, transportation availability, culture, race, or location.  Largely, this type of evaluation assumes a ‘one size fits all’ treatment approach if it does not account for differences among and between the participant population and providers.    Another barrier for this study is that it does not capture why crime may be increasing or decreasing, as crime rates can change based on changes to the law, changes to enforcement, patterns of enforcement, or in response to economic changes.  </p>
        <p>Continued studies may also benefit from assessing if there are statewide demographic or spatial patterns related to program outcomes for each type of program.  Future studies may also benefit from documenting if there were macro systematic changes such as changes in poverty, laws and regulation, or enforcement patterns that influenced crime rates, as this type of information could better inform prevention efforts. </p>  
        <p>Now that we know more about this article, please go to <a href="https://www.menti.com/" target="_blank">www.menti.com</a>, type in the code 42 11 86 7 and answer the question below.  Is this study reflective of a program evaluation, an economic analysis, or does it include elements of both? Be prepared to expand on your answer in this week's Packback :) </p>  
        <p>If you are interested in learning more about this study or in seeing the cost-benefit results updated for 2019, please visit the <a href="https://www.wsipp.wa.gov/BenefitCost" target="_blank">Washington State Institute for Public Policy Benefit-Cost Page</a>.  The results now also include a percentage score of the chances the program's benefits will outweigh the costs.  Additionally, because of the success of this evaluation, the study was expanded to evaluate the benefit-cost of programs across child welfare, education, health care, mental health, substance use, public health and prevention, higher education, and workforce development.  Results for these analyses can also be located in the link referenced above. </p>
